          Quince is a library that allows C++ programs to create SQL commands, and
          to have them executed on a relational DBMS. When data accompanies an outgoing
          command, quince first converts the data from C++ types (including user-defined
          classes and structs) to the DBMS's formats; and when data comes back in
          reply, quince makes the reverse conversion. So quince is an <span class="emphasis"><em>Object
          Relational Mapper</em></span> (ORM).
        </p>
<p>
          The difference between quince and existing ORMs is this: <span class="emphasis"><em>Quince
          offers more support for sophisticated queries</em></span>. A user who knows
          the power of a relational database will want to harness it, by issuing
          commands that employ server-side calculations, WHERE clauses, SELECT clauses,
          JOINs, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, INTERSECT, and so on, all combined and interconnected
          according to the user's own design. Quince treats such a user as the normal
          case, not an outlier. Of course it is also sometimes necessary to store
          or retrieve a single record, and quince makes that very easy to do; but
          it is only one point on a wide spectrum of possible uses. This reflects
          an underlying belief that an RDBMS is an engine of data processing as much
          as it is an engine of data storage.
        </p>
<p>
          Other ORMs make room for sophisticated queries, if at all, by asking users
          to enter literal SQL text. For an ORM to insist on this is in several ways
          retrograde: it forces the user to juggle two syntactically different languages,
          C++ and SQL, with two unrelated type systems, and while any errors of syntax
          or type consistency on the C++ side are detected early, any such errors
          on the other side go undetected until run-time, when the SQL hits the DBMS.
        </p>
<p>
          To avoid these difficulties, quince re-presents the SQL concepts in C++,
          so the user works full-time in C++ syntax with C++ data types. There are
          C++ functions <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">join</span><span class="special">()</span></code>,
          <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">distinct</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">where</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          etc., corresponding to the SQL keywords, and there are C++ operator overloads
          corresponding to SQL's arithmetic, string, relational, and logic operators.
          All of these devices are statically typed, so that type errors are caught
          at compile time. At run time, they work together to build a data structure
          that represents the user's query. And finally, when the running application
          is ready for the query to be executed, quince renders the data structure
          as correct SQL and hands it off to the DBMS.
